# What does IO wait time means and how it helps me ?


Definition of IO wait : 

For a given CPU, the I/O wait time is the time during which that CPU was idle (i.e. didnâ€™t execute any tasks) and there was at least one outstanding disk I/O operation requested by a task scheduled on that CPU (at the time it generated that I/O request).

```shell
iostat -x 1
```

Check the `wait` column and the `%util` at the bottom


If wait is 0 it means you are good :)
